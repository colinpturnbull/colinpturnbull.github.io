			  	<h2>7 Billion Ones</h2>
			  	<p class="project-date">2015</p>
          <p class="project-content"><span>BACKGROUND</span>7 Billion Ones is an ongoing movement started by local Springfield photographer Randy Bacon. It was born out of the belief that every individual has a unique, compelling story to tell, and sharing those stories can have an immense, transformative impact on those who hear it. Through photography, motion films, and creative writing, 7 Billion Ones acts as a platform for sharing people's unique stories in an artful, impactful way. This way, others may be encouraged to continue developing their own stories, and inspired to go out and make the world a better place to live.</p>
          <p class="project-content"><span>OBJECTIVE</span>For launch of their website, <a href="http://www.7billionones.org">www.7billionones.org</a>, the crew at Randy Bacon Photography wanted to host a launch party. I was asked to design a promotional poster that was to be displayed at various local businesses around town, as well as t-shirts that would be available to purchase at the event. The poster was to reflect the beliefs that inspired the start of the movement, and incorporate examples of Randy's photography. The t-shirts were to be single color, and use inspirational slogans that would pique the curiosity of anyone who has not heard of the movement.</p>
          <p class="project-content">The three posters shown at the bottom were rejects, but I'm still so happy with them I couldn't help but show them off.</p>
