			<p>Hello world! My name is Colin Turnbull, and I'm from Springfield, Missouri. I graduated from Evangel University in May of this year with a BFA in Graphic Design. Now I'm looking to improve my coding and web design skills, so I enrolled in the web design track at the Startup Institute in Boston. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, listening to music, photography, watching movies, hiking, and drinking lots of coffee in between.</p>
